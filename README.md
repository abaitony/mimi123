TensorFlowLite Object Detection on Raspberry Pi

## Introduction
TensorFlow Lite is an optimized framework for deploying lightweight deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices. 
TensorFlow Lite models have faster inference time and require less processing power, so they can be used to obtain faster 
performance in realtime applications.
